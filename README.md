# 100DaysofCoding-Day28-PomodoroTimer-TKinter
Created a Pomodoro Timer using the Tkinter Module


For this project the main body of it was setting up the canvas for the pomodoro timer. I learned a few new commands that aiding in this such as Phototype to import the image and several other. All in all, it was a great experience and I continue to tweak the code so that I may use it in my everyday quest for productivity.
